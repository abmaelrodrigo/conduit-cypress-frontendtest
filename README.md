# Language, framework and technologies used
Cypress framework was used in this project, and the test cases were created using the JavaScript language, in conjunction with the Page Objects project pattern.

To generate user data, we used the API obtained from https://randomuser.me/.

# Test Cases:

The following test cases were created to cover the main funcionalities:

- Verify user can access an article on Homepage;
- Verify user can create an account;
